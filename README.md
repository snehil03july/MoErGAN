# MoErGAN: Motion Error Generative Adversarial Network for MRI

## Introduction
MoErGAN is an innovative solution designed to address the scarcity of motion-corrupted MRI data for the development of advanced motion correction algorithms. By synthesizing realistic motion artifacts in error-free MRI images, MoErGAN facilitates the augmentation of datasets, enabling robust training and improvement of deep learning-based motion correction techniques.
